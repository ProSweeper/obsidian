Questions to ask them:
- ask about inspiration of company
- where they see the company going next
- do they see the team growing after these 2 hires
- learn about them 
- ask if they have hired the senior or where they are in that process
- maybe what the next steps look like

Project questions to prepare for
- not tooo many in depth questions
- focused on why I choose to do them
- what was the planning
- what was the timeline 
- what would I do differently
- any hiccups
	- how would I fix them
