-   main difference is how elements are inserted vs deleted
    -   Linked Lists:
        -   insertion + deletion happen in a constant amount of time if done at the head
        -   nodes of a linked list may be dispersed throughout memory
        -   access operations are O(n) since we need to traverse the list
    -   Arrays:
        -   Arrays are arranged contiguously (in sequence) in memory
        -   this contiguous arrangement allows us to index arrays
        -   access operations for an array are O(1)
    -   This Table demonstrates the performance trade offs between the two
