### Summary
- Full Stack Web app that allows for users to post jobs that they need completed around their house and for contractors be be able to bid on and perform those jobs
- Created using python and Django for the front and back end and postgreSQL for the database
- Contractors have a rating that is the average from all the home owners they have done work for and users can 
- we implemented the google maps API to allow users to view if a job was in their area
### Inspiration
- This was really about learning how to function as a team so we wanted to pick a field where we could all relate to, and chores piling up around the house was something we all knew and dreaded
- We needed to implement an app that was user centric (Django made this very easy with its built in authentication) and then have the CRUD functionality that was standard with general assembly products
### Design Philosophy
- 
### Things I would Change
- we had individuals who made the mistake of pushing to the main branch one too many times and that ended causing a lot of extra work rebasing the project and more time than we originally planned was allocated to solving these issues
- as a result of this there was a widespread fear in our group of this issue resurfacing and the cause was incorrectly identified and our solution was to only work on the project when everyone was present and only one person code at a time 
- Looking back, I knew the correct reason for our troubles and wish I was more assertive or clear in my explanation in how to solve it as we took too many steps to solve the problem and ended up severely handicapping our productivity  
### Group Work and My Role
- Overall the group was fun to work with and everyone was very knowledgeable and committed to creating a good product
	- I was severely sick for the first 2 days of our week long project and they were more than okay for me to make up the time missed over the remaining time
- My role was that of the scrum master and a general programmer. I mainly kept our meetings on track and made sure to give everyone an avenue for input 
- We did both pair programming and mob programming during this project to get a feel for industry practices
