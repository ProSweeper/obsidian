## 2. Attaching Event Handlers Using Event Props

### Browser Events in React

As a reminder, there are [hundreds of different browser events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events).

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì What's the most common browser event we've worked with during SEI?
</summary>
<hr>

`'click'`

<hr>
</details>

Like many things in React, event handling is a little different than what we are used to.

Let's see how...

### Connecting Handler Code to Events in React

In React, we do not add event listeners using JavaScript's `addEventListener` method.

Instead, we assign event handling functions to "event" props, e.g., `onClick`, on React Elements (`<div>`, `<p>`, etc.).

React supports any browser event you will ever need as documented by [this list of supported events](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html#supported-events)

Let's start by adding a `<button>` to hide/show the to-dos when clicked:

```jsx
return (
  <div className="App">
    <h1>React To-Do</h1>
    {/* Add  button below */}
    <button>{showTodos ? 'HIDE' : 'SHOW'}</button>
    ...
```

> üëÄ Any React Element that results in a visible HTML element can respond to click events, not just buttons.

Now we can use the `onClick` prop to attach an event handler, **which must be a function (this is important)**:

```html
<button onClick={alert}>{showTodos ? 'HIDE' : 'SHOW'}</button>
```

We're just passing the built-in `alert` function as a baby step.  When the button is clicked, React's event system will invoke the provided function, passing to it an event object.

Our goal is to toggle the boolean `showTodos` state value by assigning a function to the `onClick` prop that will ultimately call the `setShowTodos` setter function.

Since we don't have any significant logic to perform, we should be able to call the existing `setShowTodos` setter function inline with the `onClick` prop instead of having to write a separate function like this:

```html
<button onClick={setShowTodos(!showTodos)}>{showTodos ? 'HIDE' : 'SHOW'}</button>
```

However, due to something important mentioned earlier, the above approach won't work.

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì Why won't the following approach work?
</summary>
<hr>

**We need to provide a function, not invoke a function.**

<hr>
</details>

### Passing Arguments to Event Handlers

So, what's the solution if we need to pass arguments to an event handler function?

Check this out:

```html
<button onClick={() => setShowTodos(!showTodos)}>{showTodos ? 'HIDE' : 'SHOW'}</button>
```

As you can see, the fix is to wrap the call to `setShowTodos` with a function - thanks to their conciseness, arrow functions are great for this purpose!

Toggle those to-dos!

### Event Handling Summary

- The names of event props are camelCased (`onClick`). In HTML, the attribute would be `onclick`. Here's the [list of events](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/events.html#supported-events) supported by React.

- The JS expression (always within curly braces) assigned to an event prop must evaluate to a **function**. A function type, **not** a function call (unless that function call returns a function).

- React automatically implements event delegation and makes event handling more efficient in a React app by managing events internally - check out React's [Synthetic Event Object](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html) to learn more.

## 3. Using "Controlled Inputs" in React

### Adding New To-Dos

To add new to-dos, we could just add additional code to the `<App>` component.

However, a better approach would be to create a separate component responsible for inputting a new to-do...

### üëâ You Do - Create a new `<NewToDoForm>` Component (5 minutes)

1. Create a `<NewToDoForm>` component in its own module (named according to best practices).

2. `<NewToDoForm>` should just render an `<h2>New To-Do</h2>` for now.

3. In **App.js** below the `<ToDoList>` component, render an `<hr />` followed by the `<NewToDoForm>` component like this:

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/lHw9V7D.png">

### Forms in React Are Not Required

Forms are not required to wrap input elements in SPAs because we always send data to the server using [AJAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)), not by submitting a form.

In fact, we need to prevent forms from being submitted to the server because it will cause the page to reload which SPAs avoid.

However, we often still use forms in React for validation, layout/styling using CSS frameworks, etc.

We'll begin by adding a to-do without using a form. Then, we'll add a form later to perform validation and learn how to prevent the form from being submitted to the server which would trigger a page reload.

### Controlled Components (`<input>`)

In a typical HTML page, input elements such as `<input>`, `<textarea>` and `<select>`, maintain their own internal state.

However, handling input the "React way" is different...

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/YcDo3iJ.png">

1. The value of an input, i.e., what is displayed, is maintained by state defined in the component.

2. The state is bound to the input's `value` prop resulting in the input displaying the value of the state.

3. An event handler function assigned to the `onChange` prop is used to updating the state's value.

The above approach is what React refers to as a [controlled component/input](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components).

### Adding a Controlled `<input>`

Let's add the following JSX to **NewToDoForm.jsx**:

```jsx
export default function NewToDoForm() {
  return (
    <>
      <h2>New To-Do</h2>
      <input placeholder="New To-Do" />
      <button>ADD TO-DO</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

> üëÄ Reminder: React Elements have props such as `placeholder` that provide the functionality of their HTML attribute equivalents.

Now let's make it a controlled input by first adding state for the `<input>` as mentioned in bullet point number `1.` above.

### üëâ You Do - Add `newTodo` State (2 minutes)

1. Use the `useState` hook to add state named `newTodo`.

    > Hint: Don't forget to import `useState`

2. Initialize `newTodo` to an empty string.

3. You know what to name the setter - right?

### The Key to Controlled Inputs:  `value` & `onChange` Props 

As we saw above, all controlled inputs must include the following two props:

- `value`: This prop is used to bind the state to the input's value (what is displayed).

- `onChange`: This event prop will call the provided callback function whenever the user types in the input. Within the callback, we need to update the state variable bound to `value`.

### Bind State to the `value` Prop

Let's start by binding the newly added `newToDo` state to the `value` prop of the `<input>` in **NewToDoForm.jsx**:

```html
<input value={newTodo} placeholder="New To-Do" />
```

Easy peasy - to check it out, try initializing the state to something other than empty string.

### Handling the `onChange` Event

You just saw how the `<input>` displays the value of the state it is bound to using the `value` prop.

However, try typing in the input - nothing happens because we need to update the state as the user types.

Here's a way to update the state using the setter function and without having to define another function:

```jsx
export default function NewToDoForm() {
  const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState("");
  return (
    <>
      <h2>New To-Do</h2>
      <input
        value={newTodo}
        onChange={(evt) => setNewTodo(evt.target.value)}
        placeholder="New To-Do" />
      <button>ADD TO-DO</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

When React invokes the event handler function, it passes in an event object as an argument for which we defined a parameter, `evt`.

Then, just like in vanilla JS, the event object can be used to access the input's internal value via `evt.target.value`.

### ‚ùì Review Questions (1 min)

```html
<div onClick={setStateValue(newValue)}>Click Me!</div>
```
<details>
<summary>
(1) What is wrong with the above code?
</summary>
<hr>

**We must provide a function to an event prop, not call a function.**

As written, the code will cause an infinite loop because the setter function is being called when the component renders.

<hr>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
(2) True or False:  In a SPA, forms are required to send data to the server.
</summary>
<hr>

**False.**

In a SPA, forms are never permitted to be submitted to the server because it would cause the page to reload.

<details>

(3) What are the two props that must be added to a controlled input in React?
</summary>

<hr>
</details>

## 4. Adding the New To-Do

Now that we have the `<input>` working and know how to respond to events in React, we can add new to-dos by:

- Adding an `onClick` handler to the [ADD TO-DO] button.

- When the button is clicked, add the new to-do using the `setTodos` setter function.

- Clearing the input for a better user experience (UX).

### Adding the `onClick` Handler to the [ADD TO-DO] Button

We're not going to be able to perform all of the required logic inline this time, instead let's write an additional function within **NewToDoForm.jsx**:

```jsx
export default function NewToDoForm() {
  const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState("");

  // Add this new handler
  function handleAddTodo() {
    alert(newTodo);
  }

  ...
```

We're alerting the `newTodo` state value as a baby step.

Now let's attach the new handler by adding an `onClick` prop to the button:

```html
<button onClick={handleAddTodo}>ADD TO-DO</button>
```

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì Why didn't we have to wrap <code>handleAddTodo</code> with an arrow function in this case?
</summary>
<hr>

**We don't need to provide any arguments to `handleAddTodo` when invoking it, thus we can simply provide the function itself.**

<hr>
</details>

### Updating the `todos` State

Let's answer the following questions...

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì Which component "owns" the <code>todos</code> State?
</summary>
<hr>

**`<App>`**

<hr>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì Which component "owns" the setter function used to update the <code>todos</code> State?
</summary>
<hr>

**`<App>`**

<hr>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì Does the <code>&LT;NewToDoForm></code> have access to the <code>setTodos</code> setter function?
</summary>
<hr>

**No**

<hr>
</details>

So, we could solve this dilemma by passing a reference to `setTodos` as a prop.  However, we also would need to pass a reference to the `todos` state as well to use with the spread operator.

We certainly could pass those props without much hassle, however, it just doesn't feel right - instead, it makes more sense to update state within the component that owns that state, in this case, `<App>`.

So let's add a new function within **App.js** that we can then pass to `<NewToDoForm>` as a prop:

```js
const [showTodos, setShowTodos] = useState(true);

// Add this function
function addTodo(todo) {
  // Replace state, don't mutate it
  setTodos([...todos, todo]);
}
```

As discussed in the last lesson, we are using the spread syntax to include (spread) the current elements of the `todos` array within a new array literal, adding the new todo at the end.

### üëâ You Do - Pass `addTodo` to the `<NewToDoForm>` Component (2 minutes)

1. Pass the `addTodo` function from **App.js** to the `<NewToDoForm>` component using a prop with the same name.

2. Update `<NewToDoForm>` to destructure the `addTodo` prop being passed to it.

<hr />

Now we're ready to add the to-do by updating the `handleAddTodo` function in **NewToDoForm.jsx**:

```js
function handleAddTodo() {
  // alert(newTodo);
  addTodo(newTodo);
}
```

Try it out!

Now let's improve the UX...

### üëâ You Do - Reset the `<input>` Back to an Empty String (1 minute)

- Improve the UX by adding a single line of code inside of the `handleAddTodo` function that clears out the value displayed in the `<input>`.

  > Hint:  Controlled inputs get their displayed value from state!

## 5. Using `<form>` React Elements

Now that we've shown that using a `<form>` in React is optional, let's refactor "React To-Do" to use a `<form>` so that we can learn how to prevent them from being submitted to the server, etc.

### Add the `<form>` React Element

Let's start by refactoring to use a `<form>`:

```html
<form onSubmit={handleAddTodo}>
  <input
    value={newTodo}
    onChange={(evt) => setNewTodo(evt.target.value)}
    placeholder="To-Do"
  />
  <button type="submit">ADD TO-DO</button>
</form>
```

> üëÄ Forms in React will never have an `action` or `method` prop/attribute because they are never submitted to a server!

Note that we've:

- Removed the `onClick` from the button and changed its type to `type="submit"`

- Added the `onSubmit` event prop to the form - this is the typical approach when working with forms.

With the above refactor, a new to-do will only appear for a second before the form triggers a refresh when the submit button is clicked...

## 6. Preventing a `<form>` From Being Submitted

To prevent a form from being submitted, we need to invoke the `preventDefault()` method on the event object.

First we need to add a parameter to the `handleAddTodo` function to accept the event object that React passes automatically:

```js
//
function handleAddTodo(evt) {
  ...
```

Next, we invoke the `preventDefault()` method first thing:

```js
function handleAddTodo(evt) {
  evt.preventDefault();
  addTodo(newTodo);
  setNewTodo("");
}
```

Now there's no more page reload when adding a new to-do!

## 7. Validating Data In a `<form>`

Because all of the data for a form's inputs will be held in state, it's possible to validate that state every time it changes using code in the handler; setting additional state, e.g, `isValid`, accordingly.

However, we can easily take advantage of the form's HTML5 validation capabilities to ensure that data has been entered as desired.

As we saw in the lesson on Regular Expressions, we can add a `required` and `pattern` attribute to HTML inputs to validate their data. React works with these props as well!

For example, let's prevent empty to-dos from being created:

```html
<input
  value={newTodo}
  onChange={(evt) => setNewTodo(evt.target.value)}
  placeholder="To-Do"
  required
  pattern=".{4,}"
/>
```

Now, thanks to built-in HTML5 validation, the form cannot be submitted unless at least 4 characters are entered!

We've only scratched the surface of validation built-into browsers.  You can begin to learn more by reading about the comprehensive [constraint validation Web API here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Constraint_validation).

### üëâ Submit the Link to Your "React To-Do" Sandbox

Now that "React To-Do" is finished, please submit the link to your sandbox in the provided input and then navigate to the next page...

## 8. Using State to Handle Multiple Inputs

We've seen how to handle a single input within a form, but often we'll need to use several inputs for gathering all of the data we need.

Now let's put in a rep that demonstrates how to use a single state variable to hold any number of values for any number of inputs - this will also help you with the lab.

### Set Up the New Form

Create a new sandbox then copy and paste this into **App.js**:

```jsx
import "./styles.css";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <form>
        <label>NAME</label>
        <input name="name" />
        <label>EMOTION</label>
        <select name="emotion">
          <option value="üòÅ">Happy</option>
          <option value="üòê">Neutral</option>
          <option value="üò†">Angry</option>
        </select>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

We are only using a `<form>` as a "container" for the inputs - there isn't even a submit button.

Sure, there's only two inputs in this example, but the approach we're going to use applies to any number of inputs.

Here's just a bit of CSS to add to **App.css**:

```css
form {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: auto auto;
  gap: 0.5rem;
  width: 20rem;
  text-align: left;
  font-size: 1.5rem;
}
```

### Do We Really Need a State Variable For Each Input?

Imagine that we had a form with a dozen or more inputs.  Based on what you've seen thus far you might think that you would need to have a dozen or more state variables with their own setter functions, etc.

Having dedicated state for each input is not only verbose, it's also not convenient when having to send that data to a server.

Instead, as we learned in the lesson about state, a single state variable can be anything, including an object and that's our ticket:

```js
export default function App() {
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
    name: "",
    emotion: "üòÅ"
  });
  ...
```

It's no coincidence that the name of the properties on the `formData` object match the values assigned to the `name` props on the inputs. Doing so allows for the following concise `onChange` handler that will update the state for any number of inputs.

### Add the `onChange` Handler Function

Here's the only handler function we need:

```js
export default function App() {
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
    name: "",
    emotion: "üòÅ"
  });

  function handleChange(evt) {
    // Replace with new object and use a computed property
    // to update the correct property
    const newFormData = { ...formData, [evt.target.name]: evt.target.value };
    setFormData(newFormData);
  }
  ...
```

> üëÄ [Computed property names](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer#Computed_property_names) allow for a JS expression to dynamically determine the key of the property.

Similar to how we used the spread operator with arrays, we're using it here to first spread all of the existing properties within a new object literal.

Then, any additional properties are comma separated and are either added to the object, or used to updated existing properties.

### Bind the Handler to the `onChange` Event

Each input needs to have an `onChange` prop added so that the handler is invoked:

```html
<input name="name" onChange={handleChange} />
...
<select name="emotion" onChange={handleChange}>
```

That's all it takes!

We could use React Developer Tools to verify it's working, but let's add an `<h1>` to display the results instead:

```html
...
</form>
<h1>{formData.name} is {formData.emotion}</h1>
```

## 9. The Keys to Programming in React

Now that you've worked a bit with the fundamentals of React, let's look a few **key** thoughts every React developer considers when developing a React application - whether they know it or not:

1. **We code components to render (visualize) application-state**, for example, render a `<ToDoListItem>` component for each to-do in the `todos` application-state array.
2. **We can code components to render other components based upon UI-state**, for example, hide/show a component based upon `showDetails` UI-state, disable a button based upon `isValid`, etc.
3. **In response to user-interaction, we apply any necessary program logic and/or calculations and ultimately update all impacted state causing the components to re-render.**

## 10. Final Version of the Fundamentals of React Chart

Here is the completed [Fundamentals of React Chart](https://gist.github.com/jim-clark/cbc87fdf01c22f412737ca121ef70761) that is excellent to review from time-to-time, make flash cards from, or read before bedtime üòÉ

The following has been added from this lesson...
