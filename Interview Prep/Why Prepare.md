## Authenticity
Be Genuine, honest, and authentic. Do not fake who you are

## Speak the company language
tailor your communication to the company lingo
- what are their taglines
- how do they describe their brand
- how are the sentences structured on their website
- do they refer to employees by another noun?
- how do they describe their customers
By using the words they use, you are increasing the companies chances of understanding who you are

## Purpose of Behavioural Interviews
Past behaviour is a predictor of future behaviour
