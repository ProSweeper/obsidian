### 3 Categories of questions that can be asked
1.  Getting to know your career preferences, ambitions and plans
2.  Discuss details of experiences or projects written in your resume
3.  "Tell me about a time where you" type of questions where you describe how you demonstrated certain traits or responded to a situation

### From the company's perspective, the interview has two purposes:
-   Assess whether a candidate has a history of demonstrating the right behaviours that would make them successful at the company.
-   Assess the seniority of the candidate e.g. junior, senior, or staff.

### Preparing a good self introduction
When answering "tell me about yourself", you can rephrase the question into:

> "Tell me about your journey into tech. How did you get interested in coding, and why was web development (or replace with other job-specific skills) a good fit for you? How is that applicable to our role or company goals?" It is probably not a good idea to spend valuable time talking about things which aren't relevant to the job!

- keep it short, direct, and attention grabbing. 
	- In other words present your most attractive ideas in a direct manner

	- school
