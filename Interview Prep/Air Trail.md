### Why Do you want to work for Air Trail
- I am a proud edmontonian and would love to be a part of the success of a local company and feel I can help with growing this company to new heights of success
- From what I have read, the biggest benefiters of Air Trails product is the individual pilots that work for the smaller regional airlines and one of my ambitions as a software engineer is to help the little guy improve their day to day life
- My family is from Nova Scotia and Holland so as a kid I spent more time than average flying to visit family and was always in awe of the aviation scene
	- my mom was always jokingly pushing me to be a pilot as a kid so she could visit her parents for free 
- I read the article on taproot news and was un aware that the end of day paper work was included in the pilots duty day. 
	- Working as a firefighter in fort mac I worked with a lot of pilots, and every single one of them had to commit hours every day to paper work while stationed at our day base and even more when they returned to the hanger and their dwellings.
	- it was a very common complaint that they did not have time to go shopping for food or cook so they often had to spend money to get take out or if they lucked out in timing stay late at our base and have dinner with us firefighters
	- I would love to be a part of the solution that allows those pilots to have more personal time in their day as well as keeping their working hours shorter to allow for safer air travel for everyone involved
